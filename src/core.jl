    The implementer of `run_node!` must ensure:
    * **No future peeking** occurs: i.e. that no output knot is dependent on input knots
        that occur subsequently.
    * **Correct time range**: all output timestamps must be in the interval
        `[time_start, time_end)`.
    * **Consistency**: Calling `run_node!` over a single interval should give the same
        result as calling it multiple times over a decomposition of that same interval.
        This ensures that the value returned by [`evaluate`](@ref) is invariant to the
        `batch_interval` kwarg provided.
    * **Determinism**: `run_node!` should *always* be fully deterministic. If a
